# NHL Goal Prediction Application

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the probability of a shot scoring a goal in NHL games. This app processes detailed game data and generates probabilistic predictions, providing insights into shot success rates.

## Overview

* **Interactive Debugging Tool:** Allows users to visualize events on the rink given a game ID.
* **Dataset Creation:** Pulls data using REST API requests from the official NHL API and creates a comprehensive dataset.
* **Data Analysis:** Creates shot heatmaps for teams in a given year, showing their prefered shooting coordinates.
* **Probability-Based Predictions**: Outputs the likelihood of a shot being a goal rather than a binary classification.
* **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Includes key game dynamics like shot type, location, previous events, and more.
* **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to input game data and receive predictions in a dockerized application.

## Interactive Debugging Tool

The interactive debugging tool allows users to visualize events as they occur on the rink. This can be helpful in feature engineering new datasets.

## Dataset Creation

An extensive dataset was created, filtering all shots made in regular and playoff seasons between 2016 and 2024 (see ift6758/data/mileston2_data_retriever.py and ift6758/data/data_cleaner_milestone2.py).

## Data Analysis

From the dataset, shot maps were created by binning all shots by team, year, and coordinates into an array the size of the rink. Gaussian smoothing was then applied to interpolate continous values between grid lines, thus creating a heatmap. The heatmaps were generated for all teams between 2016 and 2020.

## Future Work

* Expand the dataset with additional seasons and game scenarios.
* Integrate live game data for real-time predictions.
* Experiment with other models and ensemble techniques for enhanced accuracy.
